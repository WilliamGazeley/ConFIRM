United States, All Urban Consumers, United States City Average, Consumer Prices, All Items, Index, 1982-1984 = 100. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

unemployment_rate - UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor Monthly SAUnited States, Unemployed, Rate, Total, SAThe Current Population Survey (CPS; household survey) provides information on the labor force, employment, and unemployment. It is a sample survey of about 60,000 eligible households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The reference period is generally the calendar week that contains the 12th day of the month. The sample is selected to reflect the entire civilian noninstitutional population. Based on responses to a series of questions on work and job search activities, each person 16 years and over in a sample household is classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a percent of the labor force. The labor force participation rate is the labor force as a percent of the population, and the employment-population ratio is the employed as a percent of the population.

The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

United States, All Urban Consumers, United States City Average, Consumer Prices, All Items, Index, 1982-1984 = 100. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

United States, All Urban Consumers, United States City Average, Consumer Prices, All Items, Index, 1982-1984 = 100. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured.

The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living.

The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

United States, All Urban Consumers, United States City Average, Consumer Prices, All Items, Index, 1982-1984 = 100. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

United States, All Urban Consumers, United States City Average, Consumer Prices, All Items, Index, 1982-1984 = 100. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

United States, All Urban Consumers, United States City Average, Consumer Prices, All Items, Index, 1982-1984 = 100. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included in the index. The CPI is a complex construct that combines economic theory with sampling and other statistical techniques and uses data from several surveys to produce a timely and precise measure of average price change for the consumption sector of the American economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items - goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. The quantity and quality of these items are kept essentially unchanged between major revisions so that only price changes will be measured.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a new set of relative importances of components in the consumer price index in December of each year.
