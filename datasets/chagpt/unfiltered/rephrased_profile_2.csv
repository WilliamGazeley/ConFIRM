"What is the ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) and how is it calculated?

The ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) is a monthly economic indicator that measures the level of activity in the manufacturing sector of the United States. It is calculated based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The index reflects the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month for various indicators such as new orders, production, employment, and prices.

The calculation of the index involves determining the percentage of survey responses indicating positive economic direction (higher, better, slower for supplier deliveries) and negative economic direction (lower, worse, faster for supplier deliveries). The net difference between these percentages is then combined with the diffusion index, which includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same.

Overall, the ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) provides a snapshot of the manufacturing sector's performance and can be used as a leading indicator of economic growth or contraction.",['economic_indicators.ism_mfg']
