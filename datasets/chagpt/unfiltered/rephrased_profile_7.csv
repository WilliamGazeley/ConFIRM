"What is the ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) and how is it calculated?

The ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) is a monthly economic indicator compiled by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) in the United States. It is based on data collected from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The index measures the change, if any, in various indicators related to manufacturing, such as new orders, backlog of orders, new export orders, imports, production, supplier deliveries, inventories, customers' inventories, employment, and prices.

The index is calculated by determining the percentage of survey respondents reporting each response for each indicator. The net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction and the negative economic direction is also calculated. Additionally, a diffusion index is derived, which includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same.

The ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) provides valuable insights into the current state of the manufacturing sector and can help investors like me make informed decisions regarding their investments.",['economic_indicators.ism_mfg']
