"What is the ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) and how is it calculated?

In the realm of the creative economy, the ISM Purchasing Managers Index (MFG Survey) is like a finely crafted masterpiece that gives us insights into the pulse of the manufacturing industry. It is a monthly report compiled by the Institute for Supply Management, based on data gathered from purchasing and supply executives across the United States. This survey takes into account various indicators such as New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Customers' Inventories, Employment, and Prices.

To calculate this index, the survey responses are analyzed to determine the percentage of positive and negative economic directions for each indicator. The net difference between these two is calculated, along with the diffusion index, which includes the percentage of positive responses plus half of those responding the same. This diffusion index acts as a beacon, illuminating the prevailing direction and scope of change in the manufacturing industry.

It's important to note that the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, which is composed of professionals from various industries based on their contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP), ensures a diverse perspective in capturing the essence of the manufacturing landscape. The responses collected are raw data and are never altered, ensuring the integrity of the report.

In artistic terms, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Report On Business measures the pulse of the non-manufacturing economy. It takes into account the collective opinions and insights of purchasing and supply executives from various industries across the nation. By analyzing data and utilizing diffusion indexes, this report provides a snapshot of the prevailing direction and scope of change in the non-manufacturing sector. An index reading above 50 percent indicates that the non-manufacturing economy is generally expanding, while a reading below 50 percent suggests a decline. However, it's important to note that the Supplier Deliveries Index operates in reverse, where a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries and below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries. Overall, this report serves as a flexible financial tool that sheds light on the health and trends of the non-manufacturing economy.",['economic_indicators.ism_nonmfg']
